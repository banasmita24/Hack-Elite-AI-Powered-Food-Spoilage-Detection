1	MQ-135	The MQ-135 is a gas sensor commonly used for air quality monitoring.
		It can detect gases such as ammonia (NH3), nitrogen oxides (NOx), alcohol, benzene, smoke, and carbon dioxide (CO2).
		The sensor provides both analog and digital outputs based on the intensity of the detected gas.
		Widely used in air quality control equipment and environmental monitoring systems.
2	DHT11	The DHT11 is a low-cost digital temperature and humidity sensor.
		It provides relative humidity values (20% to 90% RH) and temperature values (0°C to 50°C) via a serial data interface.
		Factory calibrated and easy to interface with microcontrollers.
		Suitable for applications such as weather stations, indoor climate monitoring, and humidity-controlled environments.
3	Pico W	The Raspberry Pi Pico W is based on the RP2040 microcontroller.
		It adds on-board single-band 2.4GHz wireless (802.11n) connectivity.
		Retains the Pico form factor, making it compatible with existing Pico projects.
		Ideal for IoT projects, remote monitoring, and wireless communication.
4	I2C Converter	An I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) serial interface adapter module.
		Uses the PCF8574 chip to convert serial data to parallel data for controlling LCD panels.
		Provides SDA (serial data) and SCL (serial clock) pins for communication with microcontrollers.
		Allows easy interfacing of LCD displays with limited pin resources.
